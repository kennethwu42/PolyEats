Our mono repo is made with a backend and a frontend. The main code for our backend directory is implemented within backend.js. This directory contains models for our database schemas accounts, restaurants, complexes, and reviews. The main functionality for each of the 4 resides in the services directory.  Files like auth.js and azureBlobStorage.js handle authentication for users and image storage, while sendVerifEmail.js and createMailTransporter.js main purpose is to create and send out emails to Cal Poly students when they make their account so it can be verified. The frontend directory, built with React, houses our components, styles, and assets displayed on our web app. Files such as VerifyEmail and login deal with the verification and login/signup process. Both the backend and frontend work together seamlessly to produce our web app.
