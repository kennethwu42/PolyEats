Our monorepo is made with a backend and a frontend. The main stuff for our backend, is implemented in backend.js. It contains models for our database schemas accountss, restaurants, complexes, and reviews. The main functionality for each of the 4 resides in the services directory.  Files like auth.js and azureBlobStorage.js handle authentication for users and image storage, while sendVerifEmail.js and createMailTransporter.js main purpose is to create and send out emails to Cal Poly students when they make their account so it can be verified.. The frontend, built with React houses our components, styles, and assests that gets displayed on our web app. Files such as VerifyEmail as well as login deals with the verification and login/signup process. Both backend and frontened work together seamlessly to produce our web app.
