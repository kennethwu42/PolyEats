This is our project PolyEats! This site is designed for Cal Poly students who
want to leave a food review at their favorite restaurant on campus or leave a
bad one if they received a bad experience. Our goal was to allow students to
decide which complexes and restaurants to go to based on reviews from other
fellow students.

How to set up the dev environment:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Configure prettier and lint in your root folder.
3. Navigate to the root directory and npm install all dependencies in the root directory's package.json.
4. Navigate to react-frontend and npm install all dependencies in react-frontend's package.json.
5. Navigate to express-backend and npm install all dependencies in express-backend's package.json.
