This is our project PolyEats! This site is designed for Cal Poly students who
want to leave a food review at their favorite restaurant on campus or leave a
bad one if they received a bad experience. Our goal was to allow students to
decide which complexes and restaurants to go to based on reviews from other
fellow students.
