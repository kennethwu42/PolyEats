Prettier: All files in this project utilize prettier to format code. In order to
ensure that all code is written with the pretter formatting, run files with
`npm run format` if the code was written prior to the integration of prettier.
Do not change the configuration of the prettier setup.

ESLint: Both frontend and backend use ESLint to format files as well. If you
would like to make changes to the ESLint formatting, feel free to discuss
changes with the team.

All packages have been installed within this project.
